How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I create software that is modular and transferable. An example of this is the CURD used in projects one and two, this CRUD is easily interchangeable between projects if needed to read, update, and remove data. Working this way give us the advantage to produce software that is easy to troubleshoot and fix. 
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I approached the database/dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested by critically analyzing the challenge to be able to understand the requirements. After doing this, I amble to understand what I need to do, and this helps me come up with different solutions and decide what will work best to complete the request that I have been asked. A technique that I have used is developing test cases for each requirement and this helps me develop tools that will support me in correctly running the application.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists find challenges, analyze them, find solutions, and test the solutions. If the solutions work, the computer scientist works on improving them and if they do not work, the computer scientist will keep trying to find a solution. This an experience of professional growth for the computer scientist, because thru trial and error, the computer scientist will learn new ways to create software that will benefit their clients. A computer scientistsâ€™ work on this type of project will help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better by helping the company save time by finding what they need in a short amount of time. In this specific project, it would have taken the company hours to find what they needed, however with our help they were able to find the information fast and effectively.
